## Day 1: 14th June 2025
`Research` `Planning`

I did some research on [r/writerDeck](https://www.reddit.com/r/writerDeck/) to see some existing designs, their use and the types of software they use. I was particularly inspired by [this design](https://www.reddit.com/r/writerDeck/comments/1jg2ka8/anyone_seen_one_of_these_before/), which makes me want to make something foldable and compact so that it is portable.

I'm not sure how possible it is to make a keyboard that is easily foldable like that. Maybe scissor switches would work but I don't think they are possible for DIY, or even a membrane keyboard but it doesn't seem very plausible either. I also really like this design:

Both the designs I really like are from Pomera. I think I will try using Low Profile keyswitches and see if I can make a case that accomodates folding. The overall design will be a lot thicker but I still think it could be really cool.

`Research: +3 hours`

I also want to have a slide out screen at the bottom which will be a 'dice roller', so one of the keys will activate it, and you can choose how many sides it has and roll it. I will make it run off a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W or Zero W, and then I will have the custom keyboard connected to a Adafruit KB2040 (RP2040) using its USB Breakout.

I drew a rough design based on these features:

I also drew a design of the keyboard folding mechanism made for a mechanical keyboard thickness:

I think I will use Kailh Choc V1 switches and then I could use custom MBK keycaps from [FK Custom](https://fkcaps.com/keycaps/mbk).
