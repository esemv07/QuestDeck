# QuestDeck
A writerDeck style Cyberdeck design specifically for TTRPGs


## What is it?
This project is a version of a writerDeck I have designed specifically to be used for TTRPGs. It has a custom keyboard as well as all custom PCBs and runs on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. The keyboard is foldable and the whole thing folds down into a book style case. It a Dice Roller OLED screen that connects to the keyboard, meaning that when the 'Roll' key is pressed, it will roll dice on the screen for you.

## Why did I make this?

I love playing TTRPGs such as DnD as well as solo TTRPGs. I like to take notes on the game and it is nice to type them out, but the issue I often experience is getting distracted by other tabs, notifications, etc. This device is a no distractions writing device meaning that I can take the noted I want without the normal distractions. I also think it is super cool to be able to have a writing tool designed to fit the theme of TTRPGs so I made the case as nice as possible to achieve this goal.
